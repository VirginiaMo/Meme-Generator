This is a simplified Meme generator.

The idea is to upload an image, and then set some text for the upper and lower parts of it. 
It also allows to modify some of the properties of the added text, such as font size and color

I have done a simple App using JavaScript and styling with CSS.
I created some inputs and buttons in HTML and then I've printed them in the DOM, and also I've added a canvas to have an easy way to modify the image: adding text, style, size, etc.
In JavaScript I've added some events to generate the meme and another one to load the images.

I've decided not to use any library for this proyect and to focus on using vanilla JavaScript.
